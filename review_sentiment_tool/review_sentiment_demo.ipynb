    "This notebook turns short reviews into something easier to work with:\n",
    "- **Sentiment**: positive / neutral / negative (with a one-line rationale)\n",
    "- **Summary**: a factual 1–2 line takeaway\n",
    "- **Rewrite**: a clearer version of the original review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Teams often need to quickly scan user feedback to spot patterns. This helps reduce noise and standardize text for dashboards, triage, or further analysis.\n",

    "**How it could be used**:\n",
    "- Auto-summarize new product reviews before sending to a support queue\n",
    "- Clean up messy feedback before storing in a data warehouse\n",
